# Computation of Overlap Components in linear time

### About
This code, written by Michael Rao, accompanies the following paper:

P. Charbit, M. Habib, V. Limouzy, F. de Montgolfier, M. Raffinot, M. Rao. 
A note on computing set overlap classes 
Information Processing Letters 108, 186â€“191, 2008.

I am using it as a step in computing the modular decomposition of directed graphs.
